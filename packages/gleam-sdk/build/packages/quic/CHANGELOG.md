# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- `versions` lists the QUIC versions a connection will also accept, for
  RFC 9368 compatible version negotiation. Contributed by jbevemyr (#243).
- `hibernate_after` (default 5000 ms) hibernates an idle connection
  process, running a fullsweep so the handshake's garbage stops being
  pinned to a heap that never collects on its own. `infinity` opts out.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#207).
- TLS secrets are written to the file named by `SSLKEYLOGFILE` when it is
  set, in the format Wireshark reads. Contributed by jbevemyr (#231).
- `max_burst_packets` bounds how many packets leave per send drain, so a
  large queued write cannot monopolise the scheduler. Contributed by
  jbevemyr (#214).
- `ack_packet_tolerance` makes the 1-RTT ACK decimation threshold
  configurable; it defaults to the RFC 9000 section 13.2.1 value of 2.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#213).

### Fixed
- A stream written in more than one `send_data/4` call no longer goes out
  interleaved. When the per-drain burst budget was spent, the unsent
  remainder was requeued at the back of its priority bucket instead of the
  front, so the drain round-robined between the queued entries and the
  stream stayed out of order for the rest of the transfer, leaving the
  receiver holding most of it for reassembly (1.2 MB buffered on a 2 MB
  transfer in 16 writes, against 0 once ordered). Throughput on loopback
  is unchanged; the cost is the reassembly buffer, and any real path where
  reordering matters.
- An authenticated distribution connection no longer drops the peer's
  first handshake message about half the time. The `auth_callback` path
  put a short-lived gatekeeper process in front of the dist controller
  and replayed its mailbox after the handoff, but the controller took
  ownership from a `gen_statem` state-enter callback, which runs after
  `start_link` has already returned; everything the connection emitted in
  between arrived at a process that had stopped reading. The controller
  now owns the connection from the first packet on the server and from
  before `start_link` returns on the client, so there is no handoff to
  race. Auth callbacks must not open streams, which never worked.
- A TLS alert raised during the handshake now reaches the peer. The
  CONNECTION_CLOSE was batched into the state `send_tls_alert/2` returns,
  which the six immediate-exit sites discarded before calling `exit/1`;
  `terminate/3` could not recover it, since it runs with the pre-alert
  state and its fallback close is skipped entirely while app keys do not
  exist. The peer saw silence and waited out its idle timeout instead of
  learning why the handshake failed. Reported by obi458 (#227).
- Two nodes dialling each other at the same time no longer deadlock over
  QUIC distribution. `net_kernel` resolves a simultaneous connect by
  killing the losing setup process and then blocking, with no timeout,
  until that process dies; the setup process trapped exits, so the signal
  became an unread message, nothing died, and the node's distribution
  machinery stayed wedged until both dials timed out. It now acts on that
  exit while it still owns the connection, and stops trapping once the
  controller has taken ownership, which is what OTP's own setup processes
  do.
- An HTTP/3 message body ends at stream end rather than at a frame
  boundary, so a response whose last DATA frame is followed by the FIN
  in a separate packet is not truncated. Contributed by jbevemyr (#244).
- A server answers a long-header packet carrying a version it does not
  support with a Version Negotiation packet (RFC 9000 section 6.1)
  instead of silence. Probing with a reserved version is how readiness
  checks and the interop runner detect a live server. A packet that is
  itself a Version Negotiation is never answered. Contributed by
  jbevemyr (#229).
- QUIC v2 (RFC 9369) uses the correct wire format: version-specific
  packet-type bits, salts and key labels, and compatible version
  negotiation settles on the first ClientHello. Contributed by
  jbevemyr (#243).
- A client switches away from a connection ID the peer has retired
  (RFC 9000 section 5.1.2) instead of continuing to use it.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#218).
- The keep-alive PING no longer spins on a connection whose peer has
  gone quiet. Contributed by jbevemyr (#221).
- An unresponsive peer is given up on after a disconnect timeout, checked
  on its own timer rather than on the PTO. Contributed by jbevemyr (#224).
- A peer address change is followed immediately and validated in the
  background, so a NAT rebind does not stall the connection while
  validation runs. Contributed by jbevemyr (#255).
- The server sends a Retry when configured to, and its cipher preference
  order is configurable rather than fixed. Contributed by jbevemyr (#232).
- The client offers the cipher suites it was configured with instead of
  always the built-in list, and honours the `version` option.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#232, #235).
- Short headers are unprotected with the negotiated cipher, so a
  connection that negotiated ChaCha20-Poly1305 no longer fails to
  decrypt. Contributed by jbevemyr (#234).
- A session ticket selects the PSK it belongs to rather than only
  feeding 0-RTT, so resumption works on its own. Contributed by
  jbevemyr (#238).
- The session-ticket table is owned by the server registry rather than
  whichever connection created it: it used to vanish with that
  connection, and a client resuming afterwards fell back to a full
  handshake. Contributed by jbevemyr (#239).
- Only the client sends 0-RTT, and 0-RTT data lost in flight is resent.
  Oversized 0-RTT writes are split, and the idle-state send path is
  gated too. Contributed by jbevemyr (#240).
- The connection-level MAX_DATA update triggers on remaining headroom
  rather than cumulative bytes received. The old comparison became
  permanently true once total received passed one window, putting an
  ack-eliciting MAX_DATA on every packet. Contributed by jbevemyr (#209).
- Retained ACK ranges are capped at 64 per packet-number space
  (RFC 9000 section 13.2.4). Under burst loss the list fragmented into
  hundreds of ranges, and every outgoing ACK encoded all of them.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#211).
- Overlapping and duplicate chunks are handled when reassembling stream
  and CRYPTO data, keeping the longer chunk at a given offset instead of
  trusting whichever arrived first. Contributed by jbevemyr (#223).
- A flow-control-blocked write no longer strands data behind a blocked
  queue head: the sendable prefix goes out, the remainder requeues in
  order, and queued data is normalised to a binary. Contributed by
  jbevemyr (#233).
- Streams are reclaimed when their FIN is acknowledged rather than when
  it is sent, so a lost FIN cannot retire the stream early. Contributed
  by jbevemyr (#236).
- MAX_STREAM_DATA is no longer sent for a stream whose final size the
  peer has already declared. Contributed by jbevemyr (#241).
- The client's retained Finished flight carries its own retransmission
  timer. Once the state machine leaves the handshake nothing is
  guaranteed to be in flight to arm a PTO, so a Finished lost more than
  once was never resent and the handshake stalled until the idle timeout.
- The GSO segment size is derived from the batch instead of a
  configured constant. 1-RTT packets follow the current max datagram
  size, so the uniformity check against the fixed 1200 never matched and
  the GSO path never ran; a batch is now split into runs of equal-sized
  packets and each run segmented on its own size. Each write is capped
  at 64 segments and 64 KB, and GSO is requested per message rather than
  as a socket-level `UDP_SEGMENT`, which segmented every datagram
  including handshake packets. Reported by jbevemyr (#196).
- The socket-backend client binds the source address from
  `extra_socket_opts` instead of leaving it to the kernel's route
  lookup, which picks the wrong address on a multi-address host.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#261).
- A GRO train reaches the client connection as one message rather than
  one per packet, so the whole train is processed in a single receive
  pass. Contributed by jbevemyr (#248).
- PTO probe packets are exempt from the congestion window and loss
  retransmissions are bound to it, per RFC 9002 section 7. A probe is
  the only thing that can restart a stalled connection, so blocking it
  on a window the peer's silence keeps closed deadlocks the transfer;
  ordinary loss retransmissions, which were previously sent regardless,
  now respect the window like any other send. Contributed by jbevemyr
  (#249).
- ACKs arriving at the Initial or Handshake encryption level no longer
  reach the 1-RTT loss tracker. Packet numbers restart per space
  (RFC 9000 §12.3), so a Handshake-space ACK of packet numbers 0..N was
  retiring the first N 1-RTT packets from the sent queue without the peer
  having received them: nothing retransmitted them and the peer kept a
  permanent hole in the stream. A path that drops a full window and then
  returns (WiFi-to-cellular handover, VPN reconnect, NAT rebind) left the
  transfer stalled for good. Contributed by jbevemyr (#250).
- The sent-packet tracker now survives an active path migration. It was
  replaced wholesale, which orphaned every packet already in flight: no
  ACK matched them, loss detection never ran, and `bytes_in_flight` read
  zero so no PTO fired either. Their data was never retransmitted and
  the peer kept a permanent hole in the stream. The path-derived
  estimates (RTT, PTO count) still reset, since those belong to the old
  path. Contributed by jbevemyr (#251).
- The PTO backoff is capped at 5 seconds. RFC 9002 section 6.2.1 doubles
  the PTO on each consecutive expiration and the doubling had no
  ceiling, so on a 50 ms path it reached roughly 90 seconds after nine
  expirations and about twelve minutes after twelve. A probe scheduled
  that far out never happens: the idle timer and any request deadline
  above it have long since fired. Contributed by jbevemyr (#254).
- The loss time threshold is `max(smoothed_rtt, latest_rtt)`
  (RFC 9002 section 6.1.2) rather than the smoothed estimate alone. When
  an RTT spike outruns the EWMA the two diverge, and the smaller
  threshold declares in-flight packets lost while their ACKs are merely
  late. Each spurious loss both retransmits data the peer already has
  and collapses the congestion window, so a single latency excursion
  (receiver queueing, bufferbloat) turned into a throughput collapse.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#210).
- PMTU probes are tracked as non-ack-eliciting, so a probe lost past the path MTU no longer inflates `bytes_in_flight`, arms the PTO machinery, or feeds a congestion event (RFC 8899 §3, RFC 9000 §14.4). Combined with an in-flight-keyed liveness check, the periodic raise probe previously killed every long-lived connection on an MTU-limited path once per 600-second raise interval, both ends at once. The raise interval is configurable as `pmtu_raise_interval`. (#264)
- The UDP_GRO control message is read as the int the kernel sends.
  Matching exactly two bytes meant the lookup never succeeded, so a
  GRO-coalesced buffer was passed up unsplit as one oversized datagram
  and dropped by the QUIC layer, which cannot re-split short-header
  packets. GRO was therefore silently losing every coalesced train.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#204).
- The GRO receive path sizes its read buffer for a maximally coalesced
  train (64 KiB). Passing 0 used the OTP default 8 KiB buffer and
  `recvmsg' silently truncated anything larger, discarding every segment
  past the first few. The client receiver also went through a plain
  `recvfrom', which never split trains at all. Contributed by jbevemyr
  (#215).
- A client whose Finished is lost now recovers. The
  Certificate(+CertificateVerify)+Finished flight goes out at the
  Handshake level, and once the client state machine left `handshaking'
  nothing retransmitted it: handshake-space packets are not in the 1-RTT
  loss tracker and the handshake retransmit timer only runs in that
  state. The client considered itself connected and sent 1-RTT data the
  server could not act on before handshake completion, while the server
  replayed its own flight against ACK-only answers, until the connection
  died on the idle timer. The flight is now retained until
  HANDSHAKE_DONE and resent from the PTO and on a duplicate
  handshake-level CRYPTO at offset 0. A write that exceeds the peer's
  flow-control limit also sends the part that fits rather than nothing,
  which is what lets the recovered connection drain its queue.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#252, #230, #225).
- Anti-amplification accounting (RFC 9000 §8.1) now also runs on the batched listener delivery path. A server whose ClientHello arrived in a GRO batch kept its amp budget at zero, deferred the handshake flight, and the handshake wedged until the connect timeout. (#263)
- A server handshake flight lost on the wire is retransmitted on the client-Initial backoff schedule until the client's Finished arrives. Initial/Handshake packets are not loss-tracked, so a lost flight previously wedged the handshake permanently: the client's Initial retransmits only elicited ACKs once the server TLS state had advanced. (#263)

### Changed
- Header protection reuses a cipher context instead of re-running the key
  schedule on every packet. Measured on an 8 MB transfer, the `crypto:*`
  share of connection-process time drops from 10.95% to 8.30%; header
  protection itself goes from 0.77us to 0.28us per mask. Both directions'
  keys are cached, since they alternate packet by packet.
- The interop runner speaks real HTTP/3 in the http3 case, serves more
  than one request per connection, issues requests concurrently within
  the peer's stream credit, and its resumption and 0-RTT cases test what
  they claim. Contributed by jbevemyr (#245).
- A mixed-size send batch on a GSO socket is split into runs of
  equal-sized packets and each run sent with one UDP_SEGMENT call,
  instead of falling back to one `sendmsg' per packet. A single
  odd-sized packet between data packets (an ACK, a flow-control update)
  previously degraded the whole batch. Contributed by jbevemyr (#217).
- Small sends are coalesced into shared packets. Contributed by jbevemyr
  (#203).
- The pacing burst allowance scales with the pacing rate rather than
  sitting at a fixed 12 packets. Pacing wakeups have roughly
  millisecond resolution, so the fixed bucket capped throughput at 12
  packets per wakeup whenever the sender outran the ACK clock,
  regardless of the configured rate. Contributed by jbevemyr (#219).
- A server with no explicit `groups` option now offers every classical
  group the crypto layer supports (x25519, secp256r1, secp384r1) instead
  of x25519 alone. A preference list holding only x25519 sent a
  HelloRetryRequest to any client whose key_share led with another
  curve, costing a full extra round trip on every such connection and
  exercising the HRR path in flows that did not need it. picoquic shares
  P-256 first, so this was every connection from it. An explicit
  `groups` option still restricts the set exactly as before.
  Contributed by jbevemyr (#246).
- The CONNECTION_CLOSE sent from terminate/3 (owner death, exit signals) reaches the wire: it was batched into an updated socket state that terminate discarded, flushing the stale one instead, so the peer never learned of the close and held a phantom connection until its idle timeout. Peers now see an owner-death close within milliseconds. (#265)

## [1.8.1] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- Post-quantum hybrid key exchange `x25519mlkem768` (draft-ietf-tls-ecdhe-mlkem, ML-KEM-768 + X25519), opt-in via `groups`. Negotiable only when the crypto library provides the ML-KEM APIs (OTP 28.1+); a `groups` option naming an unsupported group is rejected up front from `connect/4` and `start_server/3` as `{error, {unsupported_group, _}}` instead of crashing during the handshake. (#195, #198)
- `docs/INTERNAL_NETWORKS.md` covers running without a CA on a trusted subnet: why TLS cannot be disabled, and the `verify_none` and PSK-only setups for both QUIC and Erlang distribution. (#197)

### Fixed
- Initial-level CRYPTO is now chunked across Initial packets, each within the 1200-byte pre-PMTU limit, and the whole flight is replayed on retransmit. A hybrid `x25519mlkem768` ClientHello (~1360 bytes) or ServerHello Initial (~1225 bytes) no longer leaves as a single oversized datagram that is dropped on paths with an MTU below ~1470 (IPv6-over-PPPoE, WireGuard, mobile). (#195, #198)
- A peer key share that does not fit the negotiated group is answered with an `illegal_parameter` alert instead of raising inside `crypto` and taking the connection process down. The ServerHello key_share group is kept and checked against the negotiated one, each group accepts exactly one share length, and an all-zero ECDH shared secret is rejected (RFC 8446 §7.4.2). (#198)
- `start_server/3` returns `{error, no_auth_method}` when a listener has neither `cert`/`key` nor PSK configuration, as documented. The check ran after the listener had started, so the call returned `{ok, Pid}` and the pool then collapsed. (#197)
- `connect/4` and `start_server/3` reject a `groups` option that is not a non-empty list rather than failing later inside the connection. (#198)

### Changed
- The `verify` default is documented correctly as `verify_peer`: clients validate the server certificate unless told otherwise. `docs/CLIENT_GUIDE.md` and `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` both listed the default as no verification. (#197)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- The client hostname check applies the RFC 6125 HTTPS rules, so a wildcard SAN such as `*.example.com` matches `host.example.com`. Servers behind a wildcard-only certificate, `www.google.com` among them, were rejected as `{hostname_mismatch, _}`. (#188)
- A Happy Eyeballs winner hands its owner the events it delivered before reporting `connected`. A server that sends its HTTP/3 SETTINGS in the same flight as the handshake had them dropped, so `quic_h3:connect/3` timed out for a multi-address host. (#188)
- A client that receives a Retry keeps counting Initial packet numbers up (RFC 9000 §17.2.5.3) instead of restarting at 0, so the retried Initial is not a replay of the packet the Retry answered. The pre-Retry Initials leave loss detection instead of staying charged as bytes in flight.
- A client acts on a Version Negotiation packet (RFC 9000 §6.2) instead of misparsing and dropping it: no shared version closes the connection as `{version_negotiation, Versions}`, and a packet that arrives late, carries a foreign connection ID, or offers back our own version is discarded.
- The advertised `max_udp_payload_size` is what we are willing to receive rather than the PMTU probing ceiling: the `max_udp_payload_size` option when set, otherwise 1472 over IPv4 and 1452 over IPv6. Both roles used to advertise 1500, which does not fit a 1500-byte path. (#184)

### Changed
- A handshake failure reaches the owner as `{quic, Conn, {error, Reason}}`, tagged with the connection handle like every other owner event; the connection reference used to be the tag and nothing matched it. `quic_h3:connect/3` passes the reason through, so a rejected certificate returns `{error, {certificate_invalid, _}}` rather than `{error, connect_timeout}`, and an exhausted Happy Eyeballs race returns the last attempt's reason rather than `all_attempts_failed`. Owners matching `{quic, ConnRef, {error, _}}` must match the handle instead.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- An HTTP/3 connection process now stops with `normal` when the underlying QUIC connection closes cleanly (graceful drain, idle timeout, shutdown), instead of the abnormal reason `quic_closed`. Clean closes no longer emit ERROR and CRASH reports or kill non-trapping linked owners; an abnormal QUIC exit still stops the H3 process, now as `{quic_closed, Reason}`. The owner also receives the `{quic_h3, Conn, closed}` notification on this path, which was previously skipped. (#186)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Stateless reset on restart (RFC 9000 §10.3). A server advertises a `stateless_reset_token` transport parameter bound to its initial connection ID and, after losing connection state (for example a restart), replies to an unroutable 1-RTT packet with a stateless reset derived from the same secret. A client stores the advertised token and recognises the reset, tearing the dead connection down promptly instead of waiting for its idle timer. Contributed by sstrollo (#177).
- `require_client_cert` server option for mutual TLS. With `verify => true` the server requests a client certificate and validates any presented chain against `cacerts`; `require_client_cert => true` additionally rejects a client that sends no certificate (`certificate_required`), making mutual TLS mandatory. Contributed by sstrollo (#178).

### Security
- The server now validates the client certificate chain in mutual TLS. With `verify => true` a presented client certificate is checked against the configured trust anchors (`cacerts`, OS store by default) in addition to the CertificateVerify signature, so a self-signed or otherwise untrusted certificate is rejected instead of accepted. An empty client certificate is still accepted by default (optional mTLS, RFC 8446 §4.4.2.4); set `require_client_cert => true` to require one. Contributed by sstrollo (#178).

### Fixed
- HTTP/3 client connections close cleanly on an invalid peer SETTINGS frame instead of crashing the connection process. A SETTINGS violation (for example `SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM` advertised without the QUIC `max_datagram_frame_size` transport parameter) is reported to the owner as `{error, 265, _}` (H3_SETTINGS_ERROR) and the connection closes, rather than the state machine terminating with `bad_return_from_state_function` and taking the owner's request down. (#172)
- The connection idle timer is driven by received activity (RFC 9000 §10.1): it restarts on every received packet and on the first ack-eliciting packet sent since the last receive, but not on subsequent sends. A connection sending keep-alive PINGs or PTO retransmits into a black hole now idle-closes instead of holding its own timer open forever, while a reactivated idle connection is not closed before its first ack returns. Contributed by sstrollo (#174).
- Connection-level MAX_DATA slides forward with received bytes instead of capping the absolute limit at the receive window, so a sustained transfer no longer stalls permanently once the connection has received `fc_max_receive_window` (8 MiB) bytes in total. Contributed by sstrollo (#176), reported independently by maslowalex (#173).

### Changed
- Per-packet routing traces in the listener are logged at debug instead of info, so a busy or post-restart listener no longer floods the log. Contributed by sstrollo (#175).

## [1.6.5] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `quic_h3:respond/5` sends an HTTP/3 response status, headers and full body with end-stream in a single connection call, coalescing what previously took `send_response/4` plus `send_data/4`. HEAD, 204 and 304 responses send no body.
- `quic:start_server/3` accepts a `sni_callback` that selects the server certificate and key per connection from the ClientHello SNI (RFC 6066 §3), so an HTTP/3 listener can present different certificates per hostname. The callback is invoked with the parsed `server_name` and returns `{ok, #{cert => Cert, key => Key, cert_chain => Chain}}` or `{error, _}`; an error, malformed result or raised exception fails the handshake with a `handshake_failure` alert. The static `cert`/`key` remain the default when no callback is set.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- HTTP/3 no longer accumulates received DATA payloads in the stream record. Data still reaches owners and handlers through the existing delivery path, while Content-Length and unbounded-body limits are enforced from a byte counter. The `#h3_stream.body` field is retained for compatibility but is no longer populated.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- `quic:safe_close/1,2,3` closes a connection and ignores any error if it is already gone, for teardown paths that must not crash.

### Fixed
- HTTP/3 connection errors now send a CONNECTION_CLOSE. `handle_connection_error` passed the error reason straight to `quic:close/3`, but several call sites supply a non-binary reason, which failed the function's binary guard and was swallowed by a surrounding `catch`, so the connection was left open. The reason is now coerced to a binary phrase.

### Changed
- Replaced the deprecated bare `catch` expressions in the library and test suites with `try ... catch`, clearing the OTP 27+ compiler warnings. CI now runs the unit tests on OTP 26, 27, 28 and 29 (the matrix previously collapsed to one OTP version per OS).

## [1.6.2] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- Happy Eyeballs + HTTP/3: a client connecting to a hostname that resolves to more than one address (so the race path runs) could hang in `quic_h3:connect/3` until `connect_timeout`. The QUIC connection completes its handshake while owned by the race coordinator, so the server's HTTP/3 control stream and SETTINGS were delivered to the transient owner and dropped before the H3 connection process existed. `set_owner` re-delivers `{connected}` but not that already-arrived stream data; the race coordinator and `quic_h3:connect/3` now forward the buffered `{quic, Conn, _}` backlog to the new owner at each ownership handoff. Diagnosed and originally fixed by ycastorium (#160, #161).
- Server certificate validation recovers from an expired cross-signed root. When the served chain anchors at an expired cross-signed root (Let's Encrypt ISRG Root X2 cross-signed by the now-expired ISRG Root X1) and the trust store holds a still-valid root with the same public key, the client retries the alternative trust anchors instead of failing with `cert_expired`. A genuinely expired leaf or intermediate still fails.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- Server-side 0-RTT acceptance now works end to end. The server echoes the empty `early_data` extension in EncryptedExtensions when it accepts 0-RTT, so a resuming client reports `early_data_accepted/1 =:= true` instead of always seeing the data rejected. Inbound 0-RTT frames are dispatched at the application level, so the early request and its control/QPACK streams are processed rather than dropped, and the resumed request completes normally.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- 0-RTT (early data) support. On resumption a client can send application data in its first flight, and HTTP/3 can issue an early request, before the handshake completes. `quic:has_early_keys/1` reports whether 0-RTT keys are available, and `quic:early_data_accepted/1` / `quic_h3:early_data_accepted/1` report whether the server accepted the early data. (#148)
- `quic_listener:get_sockname/1` and `quic:get_server_sockname/1` return the listener's bound `{IP, Port}`, resolved live from the socket so it is correct when the listener was opened with `inet6`, `{ip, _}` or `{ifaddr, _}`. (#153)

### Fixed
- Streams aborted with RESET_STREAM_AT are reclaimed from the connection's stream map once their reliable obligation is met (local reset: reliable bytes acked; incoming reset: reliable bytes delivered), instead of being retained for the life of the connection. Data beyond the reliable size is trimmed from the send queue and retransmit path, and dropped on receive. (#152)
- A lost-packet retransmission deferred by congestion control is re-queued and resent when the window reopens, instead of being dropped (it had already been removed from the sent queue, so it was never retried).
- STREAM data referencing a locally-initiated stream that was never opened is rejected with STREAM_STATE_ERROR instead of creating the stream. (#152)
- Erlang distribution over QUIC: the keep-alive PING is paced off `net_ticktime` instead of the QUIC idle timeout, so a healthy connection is no longer declared down by `net_kernel` under load. (#157)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- IPv6 client connections: `quic:connect/4` accepts a hostname, an IP-literal string (IPv4 or IPv6, optionally bracketed), or an `inet:ip_address()` tuple. Dual-stack hostnames use RFC 8305 Happy Eyeballs (IPv6-first racing) with `happy_eyeballs`, `family`, `connection_attempt_delay` and `connect_timeout` options. A hostname that fails to resolve returns `{error, Reason}` instead of dialing a default address. (#150)
- Listeners can bind to IPv6: pass `inet6` or an IPv6 `{ip, Addr}` in `extra_socket_opts`; the address family is inferred from those options. (#149)

## [1.4.5] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- Server certificate chain validation accepts chains where the server sends an extra or cross-signed cert above the cert that actually anchors. The previous topmost-only anchor lookup rejected valid chains (notably `cloudflare.com` over Google Trust Services on Mozilla NSS, `certifi` and FreeBSD `ca_root_nss`) with `unknown_ca`. The client now walks the served chain for the highest cert whose issuer is in the trust store and validates the sub-path from there.
- Server certificate verification failures reach the QUIC owner as a synchronous `{closed, {certificate_invalid, _}}` event alongside the existing `{error, {certificate_invalid, _}}` notification, so HTTP/3 clients waiting on the close fail fast instead of stalling until their connect timeout fires.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-05-28

### Security
- The QUIC client now authenticates the server. It verifies the CertificateVerify signature, validates the certificate chain against the trust store (`cacerts` option, OS store by default), and checks the hostname. Previously `verify` was a no-op on the client, so any certificate was accepted and a man-in-the-middle on the network path could impersonate any server. `verify` now defaults to on for clients; set `verify => false` to accept any certificate (for example self-signed test servers). HTTP/3 uses the same client and is fixed too. (GHSA-2r8v-p65x-3663, CVE-2026-49457, CWE-295). Reported by benmmurphy.
- Hardening from a full security review: 3x anti-amplification limit with Initial retransmission, CRYPTO-buffer and listener connection caps, MAX_STREAMS and connection-ID limit enforcement, resumption PSK binder verification with single-use 0-RTT, TLS 1.3 handshake state guards, AEAD usage-limit key update, working address-validation Retry with constant-time token compares, and stricter HTTP/3 and QPACK decoding.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- QPACK Encoded Field Section Prefix and dynamic table now follow RFC 9204, so the encoder interoperates with strict decoders such as nghttp3. The Base is signalled as S=0 (Base = Required Insert Count), the Required Insert Count is written as an 8-bit prefix integer, and the Insert With Literal Name opcode and dynamic-table field-section encoding are corrected. (#142)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- HTTP/3 extended CONNECT (RFC 9220) regressed in 1.4.1: the response-HEADERS coalescing introduced in 1.4.1 buffered a CONNECT tunnel's `200` until the first DATA frame, but a tunnel server sends no DATA until the client does and the client waits for the `200`, so the tunnel deadlocked (WebTransport and WebSocket-over-H3). CONNECT responses now flush the `200` immediately; plain H3 responses still coalesce headers with the first body chunk.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-23

### Changed
- Idle and keep-alive timers are now lazy: armed once at connection setup and re-armed only when they fire, from the `last_activity` timestamp, instead of being cancelled and rescheduled on every packet. (#140)
- HTTP/3 responses coalesce the HEADERS frame with the first DATA frame, so a response's headers and first body bytes go out in one 1-RTT packet instead of two. A large body still fragments as before. (#141)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- TLS 1.3 external PSK (RFC 8446 §4.2.11). Client `external_psk` and server `psks` / `psk_callback` options, both `psk_dhe_ke` and `psk_ke` modes, constant-time server-side binder verification, cert and PSK coexistence on one listener, and client downgrade protection. `quic_dist` can authenticate node-to-node with a shared PSK and no certificates. See `docs/PSK.md`. (#133)
- TLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest with multi-group key exchange. The `groups` option advertises `x25519`, `secp256r1` and `secp384r1`; a server that prefers a group the client did not key-share triggers a HelloRetryRequest and the client retries transparently. (#135)
- Per-handshake signature negotiation via the `signature_algs` option, adding ECDSA secp384r1-SHA384, RSA-PSS-RSAE SHA384/512 and Ed25519 sign/verify. The `connected` event now reports `negotiated_group` and `negotiated_scheme`. (#135)
- Per-pair multi-stream routing for Erlang distribution over QUIC. Dist messages are hashed by `{From, To}` across 16 streams to send concurrently while preserving order within each sender/receiver pair. (#132)
- `SECURITY.md` with a private vulnerability reporting policy.

### Changed
- HTTP/3 header field-character validation inlines the character class into the scanner clause guards, removing a per-byte predicate call from a request hot path. (#136)

### Fixed
- The server now segments its TLS handshake flight so no datagram exceeds `max_udp_payload_size`. The 3-5 KB flight previously went out as one UDP datagram that clients enforcing their advertised limit (Chromium) dropped, stalling the handshake until idle timeout. (#134, #137)
- ex_doc generation no longer breaks on a `@doc` tag preceding a `-callback`. (#129)

## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- `quic:get_path_stats/1` returns a snapshot of the connection's path metrics (srtt / latest_rtt / min_rtt / rtt_var in microseconds, plus cwnd, bytes_in_flight, in_recovery, congested) for downstream routing layers. Backward-compatible; off the packet-processing path. (#127)
- `quic_dist` `auth_callback` option runs a custom `{Mod,Fun}` (or `fun/3`) on both sides between the QUIC handshake and the dist_util handshake. `{error, _}` closes the connection without ever starting the dist controller. New `quic_dist_auth` behaviour. (#126)
- `quic_dist` `register_with_epmd` option (default `false`) registers the listening port via the configured `epmd_module` so external tooling (e.g. `epmd -names`) can resolve the node. (#126)

## [1.3.2] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- `priv/bin/quic_call.sh`, an `erl_call`-style one-shot RPC helper for `quic_dist` clusters. Boots a hidden probe node with `-proto_dist quic`, runs `rpc:call/5` against the target, asks the target to disconnect so the hidden-node entry is reaped immediately, and halts. Reuses the cluster's `sys.config` (`-C`) for credentials and discovery; cert/key can also be passed via `--cert`/`--key`. (#123, #124)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- `socket_backend => adapter` lets callers plug their own datagram transport (for example a MASQUE CONNECT-UDP session) under a QUIC client. The adapter map carries `send_fun` (and optional `close_fun`, `socket_ref`); batching, GSO and GRO are forced off, and connection migration is rejected on this path. (#121)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-25

QUIC and HTTP/3 protocol-conformance hardening: closes the silent-drop
of CONNECTION_CLOSE at handshake-time violations, replaces the
unmaintained h3spec runner with an in-tree RFC 9114 / 9204 compliance
suite, and fixes two externally-reported stream-API bugs.

### Added
- `close_with_error/6` emits CONNECTION_CLOSE at the right encryption level (initial / handshake / app), with fallback to the lower available level. (#111)
- Server-side validation of peer transport parameters per RFC 9000 §18.2: server-only ids (`original_dcid`, `preferred_address`, `retry_scid`, `stateless_reset_token`) and numeric ranges (`max_udp_payload_size` ≥ 1200, `ack_delay_exponent` ≤ 20, `max_ack_delay` < 2^14). (#111)
- Frame-pipeline guards: zero-frame packet → `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`; unknown frame type → `FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR`. (#111)
- HTTP/3 RFC 9114 + 9204 conformance: 30 in-tree unit tests covering control-stream rules, pseudo-headers, stream-type uniqueness, push-id bounds, CONNECT validation, QPACK static-index and capacity limits, RFC 9218 priority signal, RFC 9297 SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM. (#112)
- `docs/h3_compliance.md`: RFC 9114 / 9204 / 9218 / 9297 matrix mapping every MUST and SHOULD to its test. (#112)

### Fixed
- Reject request streams carrying `:status` pseudo-header (RFC 9114 §4.3.1). (#112)
- `quic_qpack:set_dynamic_capacity/2` clamps to `max_allowed_capacity` per RFC 9204 §4.3. (#112)
- `quic:reset_stream/3` keeps the stream entry alive so subsequent `quic:stop_sending/3` emits STOP_SENDING instead of returning `{error, unknown_stream}`. (#113, #115)
- `quic:close/2` with an integer reason propagates that integer as the application error code; previously every input fell through to `?QUIC_APPLICATION_ERROR` (0x0c). (#114, #116)
- NEW_TOKEN received by a server and HANDSHAKE_DONE at the wrong level now route through `close_with_error/6` so the CLOSE frame reaches the peer when app keys are absent. (#111)

### Removed
- `quic_h3_h3spec_SUITE` and `docker/h3spec/`. The corpus is ported into `quic_h3_compliance_tests` as deterministic state-machine tests. (#112)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-21

Post-1.1.0 work split across three tracks: a client-side socket-backend
opt-in, a round of hot-path micro-optimisations on the send and
receive paths, and a migration fix for the default gen_udp client.

### Added
- Opt-in `socket_backend => socket` for client connections. Routes
  the client through `quic_socket:open_for_send/2` so it picks up the
  OTP socket NIF on Linux with GSO available per-message via cmsg,
  instead of the `gen_udp` port driver. +18% download throughput on
  arm64 Linux docker (10 MB bench); upload is neutral. (#88, #91)
- Client migration (`quic:migrate/1`) now works on the opt-in socket
  backend. Rebind closes the old OTP socket, stops its dedicated
  receiver process, opens a fresh one, and threads the new handle
  through the connection state. (#90)
- `quic_socket:start_client_receiver/2` / `stop_client_receiver/1`:
  dedicated receiver process for the socket-backend client path
  (the OTP socket NIF has no `{active, N}` mode). (#88)
- `quic_socket:set_socket/2` swaps the underlying socket handle
  inside a `#socket_state{}` while preserving batching configuration.
  Used by the migration rebind path. (#93)
- Instrumentation counters `ack_sent` and `retransmits` on
  `quic_connection:get_stats/1` and the throughput bench output
  (Phase 0a). (#77, #78)

### Fixed
- `quic:migrate/1` on the default gen_udp client no longer drops
  post-migrate traffic. Rebinding previously left
  `#state.socket_state` pointing at the just-closed old socket; every
  send went through the dead handle and was silently dropped. Also
  flushes any pending batch to the old socket before rebind so
  pre-migrate packets reach the server under their original CID.
  (#93)
- `quic_dist`: simultaneous-connect deadlock in the accept path.
  Two nodes dialling each other within a tight window wedged both
  `net_kernel:connect_node/1` calls indefinitely. The old accept
  path ran the dist worker through a nine-hop handoff
  (register_pending / controller rendezvous in acceptor_loop) before
  reaching `dist_util:mark_pending`, so net_kernel's tie-breaker
  arbitration never ran in time. Collapsed to the TCP-dist shape:
  `accept_connection/5` runs `set_supervisor` + `start_timer` +
  `handshake_other_started` inline. Docker 5-node regression now
  passes 5/5. (#106)
- `quic_dist`: batch-yield path in `input_handler_loop` could lose
  or reorder buffered dist bytes when the mailbox had backlog.
  Yield now threads the buffer remnant through the normal return
  channel instead of piggybacking on the self-message. (#104)
- `quic_dist_user_stream_SUITE` / `accept_user_streams/2` doc:
  refreshed to match the auto-assign / direct
  `{quic_dist_stream, _, {data, _, _}}` delivery shape. (#105)
- `docker/dist`: 3+ node cluster mesh formation. Each node now dials
  only higher-named peers and boots with `-connect_all false`, so
  `global` does not re-introduce cross-dials behind the explicit
  test topology. (#95, #106)
- h3: preserve WebTransport and unknown SETTINGS identifiers in the
  peer settings map so extension-stream hooks can read them. (#96)
- `quic_socket`: client migrate path opens the new socket before
  closing the old one, avoiding a window where the client has no
  valid send handle. (#97)
- `quic_socket`: `client_recv_loop` exits cleanly on unexpected
  socket errors instead of spinning. (#98)
- `quic_socket`: clear the pending batch buffer on flush error so
  stale frames do not get retried on the next flush. (#99)
- `quic:connect/4`: reject the `socket` + `{socket_backend, socket}`
  option combination with a clear error instead of silently
  overriding one. (#100)
- Client connection: treat receiver-process exit as a fatal error
  and close the connection, matching server behaviour. (#101)
- Server: build a per-connection sender even when
  `server_send_batching` is `false` so the direct-send path uses the
  same `quic_socket` shape as the batched path. (#102, #103)

### Performance
- Fuse per-packet cwnd + pacing check into `quic_cc:send_check/3`
  (one BIF call and one record match instead of the previous four).
  (#79)
- Hoist per-chunk lookups (`stream_urgency`, `max_stream_data_per_packet`,
  pre-computed stream-frame header prefix) out of the chunked send
  loop. (#80, #85)
- ACK 1-RTT packets immediately on reorder (RFC 9002 §6.2) while
  keeping the decimation window for in-order traffic. (#81)
- Fast-path single-stream-frame in `contains_ack_eliciting_frames/1`
  on the bulk-upload hot path. (#82)
- Thread the updated `socket_state` back from `do_socket_send` via
  the return value, dropping the process-dictionary roundtrip. (#83)
- Replace the `crypto:exor/2` NIF call with inline Erlang XOR for
  the 1-4 byte header-protection mask. (#84)
- Inline the `?QLOG_ENABLED` check at packet/frame event call
  sites so the event-map is never built when qlog is off. (#86)
- Coalesce the `monotonic_time` samples on the receive hot path
  (one BIF call per received datagram instead of three). (#87)
- Flush the pending stream-data batch before emitting an ACK-only
  packet so it does not break GSO uniformity on the opt-in socket
  backend. +6.4% upload throughput on arm64 Linux docker. (#92)
- Re-enable GSO on the opt-in socket-backend client: drop the
  socket-level `UDP_SEGMENT` setsockopt and rely on per-message cmsg
  via `flush_gso/1`. (#91)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-18

Server-side throughput work. Per-connection send batching over the
shared listener socket on Linux + socket backend coalesces outgoing
packets into sendmsg super-datagrams via UDP_SEGMENT (GSO); on macOS /
gen_udp it is functionally neutral. Several GSO correctness fixes
after CI surfaced a handshake stall. Extra observability so tests and
operators can see the batching win directly.

### Added
- Per-connection send batching on the server. Each server connection
  owns a `quic_socket` batch buffer that reuses the listener's UDP
  socket. Gated by the new `server_send_batching` option on
  `start_server/3` (default `true`); set to `false` to fall back to
  the previous direct `gen_udp:send/4` path. (#66)
- `quic_socket:info/1` — map with `backend`, `gso_supported`,
  `gso_size`, `gro_enabled`, `batching_enabled`, `max_batch_packets`,
  and the new `batch_flushes` / `packets_coalesced` counters.
- `quic_socket:send_immediate/4` — public wrapper that bypasses the
  per-connection batch for one-shot control-plane sends.
- `quic_socket:new_sender/2` — build a per-connection sender that
  inherits backend + GSO capability from the listener without owning
  the socket.
- `quic_connection:get_stats/1` now returns `batch_flushes` and
  `packets_coalesced` so tests and benchmarks can assert batching
  behaviour rather than just wiring.
- `quic_server_batching_SUITE` — behaviour-level regression: real
  256 KB server-to-client downloads assert `packets_coalesced > 1`
  when batching is on, and both counters stay at 0 when disabled.
- `docker/gso-debug/` — Erlang 28 + tcpdump + strace container that
  reproduces the GSO handshake stall against a bind-mounted tree.
  (#74)
- `bench/run_download_bench.erl` and
  `quic_throughput_bench:run_download_sink/0,1` drive server-to-client
  bulk transfers and report MB/s alongside `batch_flushes` /
  `packets_coalesced` so the batching effect is visible next to
  throughput.

### Changed
- Stream send path is iovec-native. `quic_frame:encode_iodata/1`
  returns `[Header, Data]` and threads iodata through header
  protection and `quic_aead` without copying `Data` into a fresh
  binary. AEAD specs relaxed to accept iodata.
- 1-RTT ACKs delayed to every 2nd packet or `max_ack_delay` per
  RFC 9002 §6.2. Halves receiver ACK traffic on the server and
  sender event-processing on the client. Measured on macOS gen_udp:
  10 MB upload 45 → 56 MB/s. (#69)
- `quic_loss` switched to a single `queue:queue(#sent_packet{})` for
  outstanding packets. Per-ACK work scales with the ACK window, not
  the full outstanding queue. Measured on macOS gen_udp: 10 MB
  upload 55 → 59 MB/s, 5 MB download 34 → 50 MB/s. (#72)
- `flush_gso/1` passes the batch as an iov list directly to
  `socket:sendmsg/2` with the UDP_SEGMENT cmsg, saving up to
  ~76 KB of user-space copy per flush on a 64-packet batch. (#70)
- `send_app_packet_internal/3` samples `monotonic_time` once per
  packet and reuses it for loss tracking and `last_activity`. (#71)
- Per-packet overhead on the bulk-send path reduced: single
  `#state{}` update, PTO timer reschedule skipped when within
  tolerance, `process_send_queue` and pacing timeout short-circuit
  on empty queue, stream data normalised to binary once at the
  fragmentation boundary.
- `state_to_map/1` replaces the coarse `send_batching` boolean with
  three explicit fields: `send_backend` (`direct` | `gen_udp` |
  `socket`), `send_batching_enabled`, `send_gso_supported`.

### Fixed
- Server connection crashed with `function_clause` when the listener
  was on `socket_backend => socket` because `inet:sockname/1` rejects
  `{'$socket', Ref}` handles. Branch on socket shape:
  `socket:sockname/1` for OTP socket handles, `inet:sockname/1` for
  `gen_udp` ports.
- UDP_SEGMENT `setsockopt` now uses `sizeof(int)` (32-bit native)
  instead of u16, which Linux rejected with `EINVAL`; GSO capability
  detection silently returned false and the GSO CT job was skipping.
  The cmsg path already used u16 correctly. (#67)
- GSO skipped for single-packet batches: UDP_SEGMENT with a
  sub-`gso_size` single-packet payload drops silently on
  ubuntu-24.04. `batch_count == 1` has no segmentation work; fall
  through to `flush_individual`. (#73)
- Listener no longer sets UDP_SEGMENT at socket level. A socket-wide
  UDP_SEGMENT forces segmentation on every outbound datagram,
  including short handshake packets that can't be segmented. GSO is
  now applied only via the per-message cmsg in `flush_gso`. (#73)
- GSO bypassed when a batch mixes packet sizes (padded 1200-byte
  Initial + ~400-byte Handshake). UDP_SEGMENT requires every segment
  except the last to be exactly `gso_size`, otherwise the client
  sees undecodable datagrams and stalls at
  `awaiting_encrypted_extensions`. `flush/1` checks uniformity and
  falls through to `flush_individual` when it fails. (#75)
- Listener self-send: `send_packet/6` was calling `quic_socket:send/4`
  and dropping the returned state, so version-negotiation / retry /
  stateless-reset packets were buffered then lost on the socket
  backend with `batching_enabled=true`. Switched to
  `send_immediate/4`.
- `send_queue_bytes` accounting leaked on ACK-coalesce dequeues and
  could eventually trip `?MAX_SEND_QUEUE_BYTES` on long-lived
  connections. Added `send_queue_count` as an explicit O(1)
  emptiness predicate so zero-byte FIN-only sends enqueued under
  pacing are no longer stranded.
- `examples/echo_server.erl`: `handle_connection/2` expects a DCID
  binary, not an info map; returns `{ok, HandlerPid}` so the listener
  transfers ownership; peer address fetched via `quic:peername/1`.
  (#65)
- `examples/qlog_example.erl`: added a `connection_handler` so the
  server echoes client data; waits for the client connection to
  terminate before returning so the qlog writer flushes. (#68)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- h3: thread FIN through the peer uni stream-type dispatch so a
  STREAM frame carrying type-varint + payload + FIN surfaces as one
  `{stream_type_data, uni, _, _, true}` event to claimed-stream
  owners (#64)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- h3: consult `stream_type_handler` on fresh peer-initiated bidi
  streams so extensions can claim them before default request
  handling (#62)
- docs: `rebar3 ex_doc` now runs clean (#63)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-15

First release with HTTP/3. Brings full client + server HTTP/3
(RFC 9114) with QPACK (RFC 9204), HTTP Datagrams (RFC 9297),
Server Push, Extensible Priorities, Extended CONNECT, and the
extension-stream hooks WebTransport needs. Also a critical
flow-control deadlock fix in the QUIC core, a BBR loopback
throughput fix, and the H3 server owner default change.

### HTTP/3 (`quic_h3`, new module)

#### Added
- HTTP/3 client and server (RFC 9114) with QPACK header compression
  (RFC 9204): request/response, body data, trailers, GOAWAY,
  cancellation, CLI tools (`bin/quic_h3c`, `bin/quic_h3d`)
- Server Push (RFC 9114 §4.6): `push/3`, `send_push_response/4`,
  `send_push_data/4`, `set_max_push_id/2`, `cancel_push/2`
- Extensible Priorities (RFC 9218): `priority` request option,
  PRIORITY_UPDATE frames, urgency / incremental hints
- Extended CONNECT (RFC 9220) for WebTransport-style upgrades
- HTTP Datagrams (RFC 9297): `send_datagram/3`,
  `h3_datagrams_enabled/1`, `max_datagram_size/2`, capsule framing
- Extension-stream hook: `stream_type_handler` option on
  `start_server/3` claims peer-initiated uni and bidi streams whose
  first varint matches a caller-supplied filter; claimed bytes are
  delivered as `{stream_type_data, ...}` owner messages instead of
  being parsed as HTTP/3 requests. Owner also receives
  `stream_type_open`, `stream_type_closed`, `stream_type_reset`,
  `stream_type_stop_sending` events
- Client-initiated extension streams: `quic_h3:open_bidi_stream/1,2`
  pre-claims a bidi stream with a signal-type varint (e.g.
  WebTransport's `0x41`) so inbound bytes route through the
  claimed-bidi path
- Per-connection owner override via `connection_handler` callback on
  `start_server/3` for hosting many sessions per listener
- Per-stream handler registration: `set_stream_handler/3,4`,
  `unset_stream_handler/2` to redirect body data to a worker pid
- Query API: `get_settings/1`, `get_peer_settings/1`,
  `get_quic_conn/1`
- Documentation: `docs/HTTP3.md` reference + benchmarks section
- E2E test infrastructure: `quic_h3_e2e_SUITE`, `quic_h3_h3spec_SUITE`,
  `quic_h3_owner_SUITE`; dedicated CI job
- Performance benchmark: `quic_h3_bench`

#### Changed
- Server connection owner now defaults to the listener gen_server
  (long-lived, trap_exit'ed) instead of the `start_server` caller
  pid; durable owners for datagram / stream-type events should be
  supplied via the per-connection `connection_handler` callback
- SETTINGS directionality validation tightened to RFC 9114

#### Fixed
- Server connections wedged with `connect_timeout` when the process
  that called `start_server/3` exited before a client arrived and
  either `h3_datagram_enabled` or `stream_type_handler` was set
- Discard unknown unidirectional stream payload (RFC 9114 §6.2
  unknown-stream-type rule) instead of erroring the connection
- Emit trailing empty DATA event when response carries FIN so owners
  always see `Fin = true` exactly once
- Strict PRIORITY_UPDATE frame parsing per RFC 9218
- DoS hardening on header / capsule / frame parsing
- Header / trailer / `:path` / `:status` symmetry between client and
  server validation
- GOAWAY drain enforcement: reject new requests after a GOAWAY is
  sent or received
- Server push lifecycle correctness (PUSH_PROMISE pairing, duplicate
  detection, MAX_PUSH_ID enforcement)
- Tighten RFC 9114 / 9204 compliance across multiple parsers
- `sync` option on `connect/3` resolves an E2E race where the client
  tried to send before SETTINGS exchange completed
- Improved frame error handling and header validation
- aioquic SETTINGS compatibility
- QPACK: encoder eviction guard prevents references to
  unacknowledged dynamic-table entries; rejects `Increment = 0`

### QUIC transport

#### Added
- Spin bit (RFC 9000 §17.4)
- Stateless reset support (RFC 9000 §10.3)
- Full NEW_TOKEN issuance and validation loop
- `RESET_STREAM_AT` transport parameter and frame plumbing
- `quic:set_congestion_control/2` runtime CC switch API
- `quic:get_peer_transport_params/1` introspection API

#### Changed
- BBR internal clock switched to microseconds; loopback transfers no
  longer pin to the InitialRtt fallback

#### Fixed
- Stream-level `MAX_STREAM_DATA` window stopped sliding once
  `recv_max_data` reached `fc_max_receive_window` (8 MB default).
  Past the cap, the auto-tune re-sent the same value forever and the
  sender stalled at 8 MB lifetime per stream. The window now slides
  past `recv_offset` like the connection-level window already does
- BBR loopback throughput regression: ms-precision clock collapsed
  delivery-rate intervals to 0/1 ms and clamped BDP to the 4-packet
  minimum, holding throughput at ~0.03 Mbps. Microsecond-precision
  internal clock restores expected behavior
- Send `MAX_STREAMS` as peer-initiated streams complete
  (RFC 9000 §4.6); previously peers could exhaust the stream-id space

### Distribution (`quic_dist`)

#### Added
- User-accessible streams API: `quic_dist:open_stream/1,2`, `send/3`,
  `close_stream/1`, `reset_stream/1,2`, `controlling_process/2`,
  `list_streams/0,1`, with acceptor pool and stream priorities
- Connection migration logging
- Distributed Erlang benchmarks + multi-node test scripts
- Per-iteration latency stats in throughput benchmark (min/p50/p99/max
  + timeout counts)

#### Changed
- Test runner logs each test's results as it returns rather than at
  the end, so a stalled middle test no longer hides the others

### Tests and infrastructure
- `quic_e2e_*_SUITE` and `quic_h3_e2e_SUITE` run against in-process
  servers; Docker no longer required for these jobs

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Full QUIC connection migration support (RFC 9000 Section 9)
  - Server-side address change detection (NAT rebinding vs active migration)
  - Path validation with PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_RESPONSE
  - CID rotation for path unlinkability
  - `disable_active_migration` transport parameter
- Application error code support for CONNECTION_CLOSE frames
- Client certificate support (`verify` server option)
- CUBIC congestion control (RFC 9438)
- BBR congestion control
- HyStart++ slow start (RFC 9406) for all CC algorithms
- UDP packet batching with GSO/GRO support
- Configurable UDP buffer sizing (recbuf/sndbuf options)
- QLOG tracing for debug visibility
- Pluggable congestion control behavior
- Stream deadlines for per-stream timeout control
- STOP_SENDING API (`quic:stop_sending/3`)
- `max_udp_payload_size` transport parameter
- Async send API and socket receive optimizations

## [0.10.2] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- Deprecated `catch` expressions replaced with `try...catch...end`
- Undefined `dynamic()` type replaced with `term()` in type specs
- CI workflow consolidated with separate unit-tests, e2e, and interop jobs

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- ACK range encoding crash for out-of-order packets: when packets arrived out
  of order (e.g., 10, 5, 6), ACK ranges were not properly maintained in
  descending order or merged, causing negative Gap values that crashed
  `quic_varint:encode/1` with `badarg`

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- RFC 9312 QUIC-LB Connection ID encoding support for load balancer routing
- New `quic_lb` module with three encoding algorithms:
  - Plaintext: server_id visible in CID (no encryption)
  - Stream Cipher: AES-128-CTR encryption of server_id
  - Block Cipher: 4-round Feistel network for <16 bytes, AES-CTR for 16 bytes,
    truncated cipher for >16 bytes
- `#lb_config{}` record for LB configuration (algorithm, server_id, key, nonce_len)
- `#cid_config{}` record for CID generation configuration
- `lb_config` option in `quic_listener` to enable LB-aware CID generation
- Variable DCID length support in short header packet parsing
- LB-aware CID generation in `quic_connection` for NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames
- E2E test suite `quic_lb_e2e_SUITE` with 21 integration tests
- `quic:server_spec/3` to get a child spec for embedding QUIC servers in custom
  supervision trees
- Stream reassembly test suite `quic_stream_reassembly_SUITE` for ordered delivery
  verification

### Changed
- `quic:set_owner/2` is now asynchronous (cast instead of call)

### Fixed
- `quic:get_server_port/1` now returns the actual OS-assigned port when server
  was started with port 0 (ephemeral port), instead of returning 0
- `quic:get_server_connections/1` now correctly returns connection PIDs; was
  returning empty list due to `get_listeners/1` returning supervisor pids
  instead of actual listener processes
- Removed redundant `link/1` call in listener (connection already linked via
  `gen_statem:start_link`)
- Unhandled calls in connection state machine now return `{error, {invalid_state, State}}`
  instead of silently timing out
- Server-side connection termination no longer closes shared listener socket:
  previously when a server connection terminated, it would close the UDP socket
  shared with the listener, breaking all subsequent connections
- Cancel delayed ACK timer in connection terminate to prevent timer messages
  to dead processes
- Session ticket table now has TTL (7 days) and size limit (10,000 entries) to
  prevent unbounded memory growth
- Listener now properly cleans up ETS tables on terminate (standalone mode only,
  pool mode tables are managed by the pool manager)
- Draining state now uses calculated `3 * PTO` timeout per RFC 9000 Section 10.2
  instead of hardcoded 3 seconds
- Pre-connection pending data queue now has size limit (1000 entries) to prevent
  memory exhaustion from slow handshakes
- Buffer contiguity calculation now has iteration limit to prevent stack overflow
  with highly fragmented receive buffers
- Stream data is now properly reassembled before delivery: previously data was
  delivered immediately as received, causing corruption when packets arrived out
  of order during large file transfers. Data is still streamed incrementally as
  contiguous chunks become available
- Server connections no longer modify listener's socket active state: server-side
  connections were calling `inet:setopts(Socket, [{active, once}])` on the shared
  listener socket, overriding the listener's `{active, N}` configuration and
  causing the socket to go passive after receiving packets

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Multi-pool server support with ranch-style named server pools
- `quic:start_server/3` to start named server with connection pooling

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Stream prioritization (RFC 9218): urgency-based scheduling with 8 priority
  levels (0-7) and incremental delivery flag
- `quic:set_stream_priority/4` and `quic:get_stream_priority/2` API
- Bucket-based priority queue for O(1) stream scheduling
- Preferred address handling (RFC 9000 Section 9.6): server can advertise a
  preferred address during handshake, client validates via PATH_CHALLENGE and
  automatically migrates to validated preferred address
- `preferred_ipv4` and `preferred_ipv6` listener options for server configuration
- `#preferred_address{}` record for IPv4/IPv6 addresses, CID, and reset token
- `quic_tls:encode_preferred_address/1` and `quic_tls:decode_preferred_address/1`
- Idle timeout enforcement (RFC 9000 Section 10.1): when `idle_timeout` option
  is set, internal timer automatically closes connection after timeout with no
  activity (set to 0 to disable)
- Persistent congestion detection (RFC 9002 Section 7.6): detects prolonged packet
  loss spanning > PTO * 3 and resets cwnd to minimum window
- Frame coalescing: ACK frames are coalesced with small pending stream data
  (< 500 bytes) for more efficient packet utilization

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Packet number reconstruction per RFC 9000 Appendix A: truncated packet numbers
  are now properly reconstructed using the largest received PN, fixing decryption
  failures for large responses (>255 packets with 1-byte PN encoding)

  - handshake, transfer, retry, keyupdate, chacha20, multiconnect, v2,
    resumption, zerortt, connectionmigration

### Fixed
- Connection-level flow control: now properly tracks `data_received` and sends
  MAX_DATA frames when 50% of connection window is consumed (RFC 9000 Section 4.1)
- Large downloads: interop client now writes to disk incrementally (streaming)
  instead of accumulating in memory
- Server DCID initialization: server now correctly sets DCID from client's
  Initial packet SCID field, fixing short header packet alignment
- Key update HP key preservation: header protection keys are no longer rotated
  during key updates per RFC 9001 Section 6.6
- Fixed bit validation: skip padding bytes (0x00) and invalid short headers
  (fixed bit not set) in coalesced packets
- Role-based key selection in 1-RTT packet decryption
