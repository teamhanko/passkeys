# Changelog

All notable changes to `h2` are documented here. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- `h2:serve_socket/2` runs the server connection loop over a socket the caller
  already accepted and handshook, so an embedder can own a single TLS listener,
  resolve ALPN itself, and dispatch `h2` here while sending `http/1.1`
  elsewhere. Takes the same `server_opts()` map as `start_server/2` and derives
  its connection options through the same code, so the two cannot drift. ALPN is
  not re-validated. Accepts a plain `gen_tcp` socket too, served as
  prior-knowledge h2c. Socket ownership transfers to the returned pid, which is
  linked to the caller.

### Changed

- The TLS handshake now runs in the per-connection process instead of the
  acceptor. A slow or stalled client no longer holds up that acceptor's accept
  queue. `start_server/2` behaviour is otherwise unchanged.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- `h2:peername/1` returns the peer's `{IpAddress, Port}` for a live
  connection (server or client side), reading the underlying socket via
  `inet:peername`/`ssl:peername`. Enables SIP Via received/rport for
  embedders built on h2.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- A blocking `send_data/5` whose data fully drained no longer gets
  `{error, stream_closed}` when the drain of its closing END_STREAM chunk is
  what closes the stream (peer already half-closed). `close_stream` now
  settles parked waiters by buffer state: `ok` when the send buffer drained,
  the close-reason error otherwise. Regression introduced in 0.10.3.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- A blocking `send_data/5` caller parked on flow control is now released with
  `{error, stream_reset}` (peer or local RST_STREAM) or `{error, stream_closed}`
  when the stream closes. Previously the waiter list was dropped on close, so a
  sender blocked with `#{block => infinity}` hung for the connection's lifetime
  when the peer cancelled the stream mid-backpressure.
- A server request whose HEADERS frame carries END_STREAM now delivers the
  trailing `{data, StreamId, <<>>, true}` event to the stream handler, so
  handlers waiting on end-of-stream don't hang on body-less requests. This
  mirrors the client-side behaviour and quic_h3.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Server request delivery now keeps `:authority` and `:scheme` in the handler
  `Headers` list (previously only `:protocol` survived). Adapters can reconstruct
  the request authority/scheme for virtual hosting and reverse-proxy use without
  relying on a `host` header, which a compliant client may omit. `:method` and
  `:path` are still passed as separate fields. Consumers that forward or reflect
  the header list should strip these pseudo-headers first.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-13

### Documentation

- Documented gRPC bidirectional streaming in the README and the `h2` module docs:
  per-stream handlers, half-close, receive backpressure (`consume/3`), blocking
  send (`send_data/5`), and cancel / goaway / closed delivery to the handler.
- Fixed ex_doc autolink warnings for private functions referenced in the
  changelog so the docs build clean.
- Synced the README install snippet to the current version.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- gRPC bidirectional streaming support. A dedicated per-call process can own a
  single stream's events without owning the connection, while many calls
  multiplex one connection.
  - Per-stream event routing now covers every event type. `set_stream_handler/3`
    routes `{response,...}`, `{data,...}`, `{trailers,...}`, `{informational,...}`
    and `{stream_reset,...}` to the handler, and replays in arrival order any
    events buffered before registration (previously only DATA was buffered, and
    response/trailers went only to the owner). `h2:request(Conn, Headers,
    #{handler => Pid})' sets the handler at stream creation to avoid the
    registration race.
  - Receive-side backpressure: `#{flow_control => manual}' stops auto-replenishing
    the stream receive window on dispatch; `h2:consume(Conn, StreamId, N)' sends
    the WINDOW_UPDATE after the consumer has processed N bytes, bounding a slow
    consumer to one window instead of an unbounded mailbox.
  - Send-side backpressure: `h2:send_data/5' with `#{block => Timeout}' blocks
    until the peer's window accepts the data (`ok') or the deadline passes
    (`{error, timeout}'). The default non-blocking path still returns
    `{error, send_buffer_full}' once the per-stream buffer cap is reached.
  - Teardown is delivered per stream: a stream handler now also receives
    `{goaway, Last, Code}' and `{closed, Reason}', so a bidi call process learns
    its connection is going away. `cancel/2,3' RST_STREAM continues to reach the
    peer handler as `{stream_reset, StreamId, Code}'.
  - All additions are opt-in; default streams and the existing client/server and
    WebSocket-over-h2 (extended CONNECT) APIs are unchanged.
  - Interop coverage in both directions: a real gRPC client (grpcurl) against an
    h2-hosted echo service, and our h2 client against a real grpc-python echo
    server.

### Fixed

- `send_trailers/3` no longer lets the trailers (END_STREAM) overtake DATA still
  buffered behind a closed flow-control window. The trailers are now queued and
  emitted once the send buffer drains, so a `send_data` then `send_trailers`
  sequence under backpressure (e.g. a gRPC server response) cannot drop the tail
  of the body. Surfaced by the small-window bidi stress test.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- A response's frames are written to the socket in one `Transport:send` instead
  of one send per frame. `flush_stream_one_chunk/2` now stages every
  flow-control-ready DATA frame (chunked to `peer_max_frame_size`, bounded by a
  1 MiB coalescing cap) into a single write, and the `respond/5` fast path writes
  `[HEADERS | DATA...]` in one go. A 100 KiB TLS response drops from 8 socket
  writes to 1, cutting the per-frame gen_statem round-trips and TLS-record AEAD
  encryptions; large-body throughput roughly doubles (~37k -> ~65k req/s on
  h2load `-c64 -m32` over TLS). Flow control, framing and the public API are
  unchanged; multi-megabyte bodies still yield between cap-sized batches.
- Active stream counts are maintained incrementally instead of folding the whole
  stream map on every new stream. `count_peer_active_streams/2` (checked per
  inbound HEADERS) and `count_active_streams/1` (checked per outbound request)
  are now O(1) reads of counters kept in sync by `put_stream/3`, removing an
  O(n^2) cost under stream churn. About 13% h2load throughput gain at c=100
  m=100 over h2c. No behaviour change.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- `h2:respond/5` sends a complete response (status, headers and body) in one call
  and one coalesced socket write (HEADERS plus DATA), instead of the two
  round-trips of `send_response/4` followed by `send_data/4`. It falls back to
  the granular path when the response cannot be coalesced (oversized headers or
  body, CONNECT tunnels). The existing send functions are unchanged.
- `backlog` server option (default 1024) sizes the listen queue.

### Fixed

- Connection collapse under concurrent load. The server dropped responses for
  requests pipelined before the client's SETTINGS-ACK (legal per RFC 9113): a
  handler's `send_response`/`send_data` was rejected while the connection was
  still in the `settings` state, so fast clients (h2load, browsers) lost whole
  connections under load. The server now serves while in the `settings` state.
- Client stream leak. Response HEADERS without END_STREAM reset a
  `half_closed_local` stream back to `open`, so the final DATA reached only
  `half_closed_remote` and completed streams never closed, eventually exhausting
  `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`.

### Changed

- HPACK encoder static-table lookup is an O(1) precomputed map, and the dynamic
  table is a map keyed by insertion sequence for O(1) indexed lookup, insert and
  eviction (was `lists:nth/2`).
- HPACK Huffman decoding is a table-driven 8-bit state machine (one tuple lookup
  per input byte); cold header decode is about 9x faster.
- DATA frames are sent as iodata without copying the body.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Listeners can bind a specific address or family. `start_server/2,3`
  accept `ip => inet:ip_address()` (an 8-tuple selects IPv6) and
  `inet6 => boolean()` (bind the IPv6 wildcard `::`) for both the `ssl`
  and `tcp` transports.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- OTP 29 compatibility: replaced every deprecated old-style `catch Expr` in `src/` with `try ... catch ... end`. Fire-and-forget cleanup calls now go through a private `ignore_errors/1` helper; the `--port`/`--timeout`/URL-port argument parsers use `try`. No behaviour change. The build is clean under `warnings_as_errors` on OTP 29.
- CI now runs on OTP 29.0.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-20

Security and concurrency hardening pass driven by a multi-agent audit. Several behaviour changes are flagged below; the new error returns require callers to widen their pattern matches.

### Security

- **CONTINUATION flood (Critical).** `handle_continuation` caps the raw bytes of an in-flight HEADERS+CONTINUATION block at `?MAX_HEADER_BLOCK_BYTES` (256 KB). Past the cap the connection emits `GOAWAY(ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM)`. Pre-fix a peer could OOM the node before `max_header_list_size` (which acts on decoded headers) could fire, same class as CVE-2024-27316.
- **Owner liveness (Critical).** `controlling_process/2` now monitors the new owner and demonitors the previous one. Before the fix the new owner's death produced no signal and the connection orphaned the socket.
- **`send_frame/2` error propagation (High).** `send_request` / `send_request_headers` / `send_response` / `send_data` / `send_trailers` used to reply `ok` to the caller even after `Transport:send` returned `{error, closed}`. They now stop with `{shutdown, {send_failed, Reason}}` and propagate `{error, Reason}` to the in-flight caller.
- **Peer `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE` capped (High)** at 64 KB before applying. RFC 7541 lets the peer advertise any 32-bit value; honoring it fed the encoder dynamic table (O(n) lookup) and turned a chatty peer into a CPU/memory exhaustion vector.
- **Per-stream send-buffer cap (High).** `Stream#stream.send_buffer` is capped at `?MAX_SEND_BUFFER_BYTES` (1 MB). A peer that stalls its receive window now gets `{error, send_buffer_full}` instead of growing the connection process unbounded.
- **Acceptor mailbox drain (High).** ssl and tcp acceptor loops drain queued `{'EXIT', _, _}` after every accept. Pre-fix every closed connection left an EXIT message in the trapping acceptor; on a busy server the mailbox grew without bound.
- **TLS server hardening (High).** `start_server` honors top-level `verify` (default `verify_none`), rejects `verify_peer` without `cacerts` (`{error, verify_peer_requires_cacerts}`), accepts an `ssl_opts` override list, and defaults `honor_cipher_order` to `true`.
- **Demo escript path traversal.** The `h2_server` escript's `safe_path` helper uses `filelib:safe_relative_path/2`; URL-encoded `%2e%2e` and normalised escapes (`/a/../../etc/passwd`) are now rejected.

### Breaking

- `h2:set_stream_handler/3,4` default flipped from `drain_buffer => true` to `drain_buffer => false`. The connection now replays previously-buffered DATA frames to the handler pid itself; the call returns `ok`. Callers that explicitly matched `{ok, Buf}` on the default and forwarded by hand can drop that code. Pass `#{drain_buffer => true}` to keep the old shape.
- `h2:send_data/3,4` may return `{error, send_buffer_full}` when the peer has stopped consuming. Widen any `ok = h2:send_data(...)` match.
- `h2:cancel_stream/2,3` is marked `-deprecated` in favour of `h2:cancel/2,3`. Same behaviour; compiler emits the deprecation warning.
- Default `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` is now `100` (was `unlimited`, per RFC 9113 §5.1.2 floor). Peers attempting more than 100 concurrent streams now get `RST_STREAM(REFUSED_STREAM)`.
- TLS server `start_server`: `verify_peer` without `cacerts` now fails fast with `{error, verify_peer_requires_cacerts}` instead of silently accepting unauthenticated peers.

### Added

- `?MAX_HEADER_BLOCK_BYTES` (256 KB), `?MAX_PEER_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE` (64 KB), `?MAX_SEND_BUFFER_BYTES` (1 MB), `?DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` (30 s) macros in `h2.hrl`.
- `h2_settings:setting_id/1` and `h2_settings:encode_value/1` exported; `h2_connection` reuses them so the literal-hex setting-id table cannot drift again.
- CT regressions in `h2_compliance_SUITE`:
  - `continuation_flood_triggers_enhance_your_calm_test`: > 256 KB of CONTINUATION traffic yields GOAWAY.
  - `controlling_process_monitors_new_owner_test`: killing the new owner terminates the connection.
  - `send_returns_error_on_closed_socket_test`: closed socket + `send_data` returns `{error, _}`.
  - `send_buffer_full_when_peer_stalls_window_test`: 2 MB push past stalled window yields `send_buffer_full`.
  - `set_stream_handler_default_replays_buffer_test`: the new auto-replay default is exercised.
  - `large_body_yields_to_inbound_frames_test`: PING ACK round-trips during a 512 KB upload.

### Changed

- `handle_send_data` no longer recurses inside the gen_statem callback for multi-frame bodies. It buffers the payload (subject to the cap) and `flush_stream_one_chunk/2` emits one DATA frame per gen_statem step via self-cast. Inbound frames (PING, WINDOW_UPDATE, RST_STREAM) are now interleaved with outbound chunks instead of queueing for the duration.
- HPACK decode failures and handler crashes log via `logger:error/2` (was the deprecated `error_logger:error_msg/2`). The HPACK reason term is dropped from the log line; it echoed attacker-supplied header bytes.
- An unsolicited `SETTINGS_ACK` preserves the current state name instead of forcing `connected` (still lenient-ignore, not the RFC 9113 §6.5.3 PROTOCOL_ERROR; just no longer short-circuits the preface state machine).
- `peel_reason/1` is recursive; doubly-wrapped `{shutdown, {shutdown, _}}` reasons collapse to the inner value.
- Default ssl/tcp transport tag, ALPN, and timeouts all flow from `?DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` (30 s).

### Fixed

- `set_active/2` on a closed socket no longer crashes the gen_statem with `badmatch`; the connection stops cleanly with `{shutdown, {socket_error, _}}`.
- `cancel_timer` uses synchronous cancel + flushes any already-delivered `{timeout, Ref, _}` so stale messages cannot match a future reused timer.
- The `h2_listener` accept loop and the `h2` server connection loop `logger:debug` unknown messages instead of silently dropping.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- `h2_settings`: WebTransport over HTTP/2 settings (draft-ietf-webtrans-http2-14 §11.2). IDs `0x2b61`-`0x2b66` encode/decode as `wt_initial_max_data`, `wt_initial_max_stream_data_uni`, `wt_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local`, `wt_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote`, `wt_initial_max_streams_uni`, `wt_initial_max_streams_bidi`. No defaults: absence means "not advertised".

### Changed
- `h2_settings:decode/1`: unknown setting IDs are preserved under their raw 16-bit integer key in the returned map instead of being dropped. RFC 7540 §6.5.2 "MUST ignore" means "do not act on", not "discard"; keeping them lets higher layers (e.g. WebTransport) inspect extension settings without a patch here. `h2_settings:encode/1` also accepts integer keys for symmetric round-trip.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-15

Listener robustness + TLS regression guard. The server listener no longer dies when the process that called `h2:start_server/2` exits, which broke test helpers and init callbacks spinning up short-lived listeners.

### Added
- `h2_app` / `h2_sup` / `h2_listener`: `h2` is now a proper OTP application with a top-level `simple_one_for_one` supervisor for per-server listeners. Server listeners live under the application supervision tree instead of being linked to the caller of `h2:start_server/2`.
- CT regression `tls_transport_tag_detected_test` in `h2_compliance_SUITE`: asserts `h2_connection` classifies the TLS socket as `ssl` (not `gen_tcp`) after connect, so any future drift in OTP's `sslsocket` tuple shape is caught early.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `h2:start_server/2` now requires the `h2` application to be started (`application:ensure_started(h2)`). Previously it worked from any process; now it registers a child under `h2_sup`.
- `h2:stop_server/1` sends a stop message to the listener process and lets it shut down the acceptor pool and close the listen socket under OTP supervision.

### Fixed
- `wait_connected/1,2` callers and the `{h2, Conn, connected}` owner event are now fired inline from `handle_frame` when the first SETTINGS ack transitions the connection to `connected`. Previously, if the same socket read buffer also contained a frame that caused a connection error, `gen_statem` would enter `closing` before the `connected` state-enter callback ran and waiters would only see the teardown reply.
- `closing` state-enter now replies to any still-queued `wait_connected/1,2` callers with `{error, ErrorCode}` instead of leaving them to time out.
- `closing` state-enter now half-closes the write side (`shutdown(write)`) and keeps reading to drain the recv buffer before the final close. A full `close()` with unread peer data was causing Linux to emit RST instead of FIN, which masked our GOAWAY on the h2spec oversized-frame case (`4.2 / 2: Sends a large size DATA frame that exceeds SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-15

Third review pass + h2spec interop; behaviour-visible spec fixes across the whole state machine. No breaking API change, but callers that matched on specific error atoms may see different values on edge cases (ALPN, ENABLE_PUSH, IWS).

### Added
- External interop suite `test/h2_interop_SUITE.erl` drives the server from [h2spec](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec). Six groups: TLS generic/HPACK, h2c plaintext generic/HPACK, small-window (forced flow-control fragmentation), `--strict` mode. 146/146 generic+HPACK cases pass. Skips cleanly when `h2spec` is not on `$PATH`.
- `.github/workflows/interop.yml`: CI runs h2spec v2.6.0 on every push/PR; logs uploaded on failure.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: now runs `h2_compliance_SUITE` in addition to eunit; CT logs uploaded on failure.
- PING/RST_STREAM flood mitigation (RFC 9113 §10.5): per-second counters per connection, GOAWAY(ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM) on overflow.
- Extended CONNECT (RFC 8441): server opt-in via `h2:start_server(Port, #{enable_connect_protocol => true, ...})` advertises `SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL=1`. Client uses `h2:request(Conn, Headers, #{protocol => <<"websocket">>})`. New errors: `{error, extended_connect_disabled}`, `{error, extended_connect_method}`. Inbound: server rejects `:protocol` with stream `PROTOCOL_ERROR` if it has not opted in.
- `h2:start_server` honors `transport => tcp` (cleartext h2c prior-knowledge listener with gen_tcp acceptor pool).
- `h2:connect/3` top-level `verify` and `cacerts` options merged into SSL options.
- Owner event `{h2, Conn, {informational, StreamId, Status, Headers}}` for 1xx interim responses (excluding 101).
- Send-side header validation runs before HPACK encode on `send_request`, `send_request_headers`, `send_response`, and `send_trailers`.
- README: "Using with Ranch" and "Coexisting with HTTP/1.1" sections with code sketches.

### Changed
- `SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH` default is now **0** (was 1). Server advertises 0; inbound PUSH_PROMISE on either side is a connection PROTOCOL_ERROR (RFC 9113 §6.5.2 / §8.4).
- TLS `connect/2,3` requires ALPN `h2`. Previously fell through silently on `protocol_not_negotiated`; now returns `{error, alpn_not_negotiated}` (§3.3).
- Connection-level receive window fixed at 65535 regardless of `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` (§6.9.2). IWS now only adjusts stream windows.
- Request builder no longer injects `:authority = ""` when the caller omits `host`. Non-CONNECT requests without host now send no `:authority`; CONNECT without host returns `{error, missing_authority}` (§8.3.1).
- Trailers from the peer transition the stream to `half_closed_remote` (was `closed`), so a handler mid-response isn't surprised by `invalid_stream_state` when the peer pipelines body+trailers (§5.1).
- `closing` state proactively closes the TCP/TLS socket on entry (§5.4) instead of waiting up to 5 s for the peer.
- Closed-stream error classification: closed-reason retained in a compact id → reason side map bounded at 10 000 entries. Late DATA/HEADERS on a recently-closed stream is scoped exactly (connection vs stream) regardless of whether the full record has been evicted from the 100-entry window.
- Owner event `{h2, Conn, {goaway, LastStreamId}}` is now `{goaway, LastStreamId, ErrorCode}`.
- Per-stream events (`data`, `trailers`, `stream_reset`) routed to the registered stream handler when set; connection owner receives them only as fallback.
- HEADERS whose encoded block exceeds peer `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` are split into HEADERS + CONTINUATION chain (§4.2).
- Body-less responses (HEAD / 204 / 304) emit a trailing `{data, Sid, <<>>, true}` event so callers waiting for end-of-stream don't hang.
- HPACK: Huffman encode/decode tables precomputed once via `persistent_term` + `-on_load`; dynamic table caches length and uses a single `lists:reverse` on eviction.

### Fixed
- HEADERS/DATA on a stream closed via END_STREAM: connection STREAM_CLOSED (was stream-scoped RST) (§5.1).
- HEADERS/DATA on a stream closed via RST_STREAM: stream-scoped STREAM_CLOSED (was connection-scoped).
- CONTINUATION without an outstanding pending HEADERS: connection PROTOCOL_ERROR (§6.10).
- PRIORITY self-dependency on both the PRIORITY frame and inline HEADERS priority: stream PROTOCOL_ERROR (§5.3.1).
- PRIORITY frame with length != 5: stream FRAME_SIZE_ERROR (was connection) (§6.3).
- WINDOW_UPDATE on an idle stream: connection PROTOCOL_ERROR (was silently ignored) (§5.1).
- Unknown frame types: ignored per §4.1 (previously function_clause-crashed the connection).
- Inbound `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` enforced: peer HEADERS over our advertised limit now get `RST_STREAM(REFUSED_STREAM)` (§5.1.2).
- `SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH=1` received as client: connection PROTOCOL_ERROR (§6.5.2).
- `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` above 2³¹−1: connection FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR (was PROTOCOL_ERROR) (§6.9.2).
- Body-less responses (HEAD/204/304): accept `content-length > 0` with `END_STREAM` (RFC 9110 §9.3.2); reject when `END_STREAM` is absent on the header block.
- `in_closed_stream_range` was asymmetric in client mode (only matched peer-initiated ids); now mirrors server mode.
- HPACK decoder: truncated literal returns `{error, incomplete_string}` instead of `function_clause`.
- 1xx interim responses with `END_STREAM` or `Content-Length` → stream `PROTOCOL_ERROR` (§8.1, RFC 9110 §15.2).
- CONNECT tunnel flag no longer pre-set on the request; the stream becomes a tunnel only when the 2xx response is sent/received. Non-2xx CONNECT responses permit trailers and enforce body rules (RFC 7540 §8.3).
- `:authority` containing userinfo (`user@host`) rejected with `PROTOCOL_ERROR` on both inbound and outbound paths (§8.3.1); `check_authority_host` runs for CONNECT requests too.
- Extended CONNECT `:protocol` value validated as an RFC 7230 token (RFC 8441 §4).
- `:scheme` pseudo-header follows the actual transport (`http` on TCP, `https` on TLS).
- `:method = CONNECT` outbound: trailers rejected with `{error, tunnel_no_trailers}`.
- `WINDOW_UPDATE` with increment 0 on a non-zero stream → stream RST_STREAM(`PROTOCOL_ERROR`) (§6.9.1).
- `:status` parsing: malformed values trigger stream `PROTOCOL_ERROR` instead of crashing the gen_statem.
- `:status = 101` rejected on both send and receive (§8.6).
- Padding counted against receive flow control (§6.1). Connection-level receive window consumed on DATA for closed or unknown streams (§5.1).
- `Content-Length` enforcement (§8.1.1): duplicate/mismatched/non-numeric/negative values → `PROTOCOL_ERROR`; DATA overshoot or END_STREAM mismatch → stream RST.
- Server-side request trailers: trailing HEADERS without END_STREAM → `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.
- Field name validation tightened to RFC 7230 `tchar` (rejects SP, HTAB, colon in regular headers, other controls, DEL, non-ASCII). Field values: leading/trailing SP/HTAB rejected in addition to NUL/CR/LF.
- `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` enforced in both directions: outbound exceed → `{error, header_list_too_large}`; inbound exceed → stream `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.

### Docs
- `docs/features.md`: PRIORITY metadata is parsed and self-dep rejected, but no scheduler is implemented (RFC 9218 supersedes RFC 7540 priorities).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-13

First usable release with a full connection-layer client and server. Previous 0.1.0 shipped only frame/HPACK primitives.

### Added
- Public API module `h2` with client and server entry points aligned with `quic_h3`:
  - `h2:connect/2,3`, `h2:wait_connected/1,2`
  - `h2:request/2,3,4,5`, `h2:send_data/3,4`, `h2:send_trailers/3`
  - `h2:start_server/2,3`, `h2:stop_server/1`, `h2:server_port/1`
  - `h2:send_response/4`, `h2:cancel/2,3`, `h2:cancel_stream/2,3`
  - `h2:set_stream_handler/3,4`, `h2:unset_stream_handler/2`
  - `h2:goaway/1,2`, `h2:close/1`, `h2:controlling_process/2`
  - `h2:get_settings/1`, `h2:get_peer_settings/1`
- `h2_connection` gen_statem implementing the full stream state machine (RFC 7540 §5.1) with flow control, SETTINGS negotiation, two-phase GOAWAY, and CONTINUATION handling.
- CONNECT tunnel mode (RFC 7540 §8.3): bidirectional byte tunnels over a stream, half-close semantics, trailers rejection, `Content-Length`/`Transfer-Encoding` rejection on 2xx.
- `h2_server` with TLS acceptor pool and ALPN `h2` negotiation.
- Owner-process event messages: `{h2, Conn, {response, ...}}`, `{data, ...}`, `{trailers, ...}`, `{stream_reset, ...}`, `{goaway, ...}`, `closed`, `connected`.
- Compliance test suite (Common Test) with 32 cases covering protocol conformance, API parity, and tunnel mode.

### Changed
- `h2_hpack`: persistent_term-backed precomputed Huffman encode tuple and sorted decode table; static table lookups via `element/2` (O(1)); dynamic table caches length and evicts with a single `lists:reverse`.
- `h2_connection`: cached `peer_max_frame_size`, `peer_initial_window_size`, `peer_max_concurrent_streams` on the state record; CONTINUATION header buffer uses `iodata()` (flattened once on END_HEADERS) instead of per-frame binary concatenation.
- Frame decoder (`h2_frame:decode/2`) takes `MaxFrameSize` and enforces per-type stream-id 0 rules (DATA/HEADERS/PRIORITY/RST_STREAM/PUSH_PROMISE/CONTINUATION reject 0; SETTINGS/PING/GOAWAY require 0).

### Fixed
- RFC 7540/7541 compliance gaps:
  - Padding bound in DATA/HEADERS frames now accepts `PadLength == byte_size(Rest)`.
  - `WINDOW_UPDATE` increment 0: stream-level RST_STREAM / connection-level GOAWAY with `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.
  - `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` change that overflows any open stream → connection `FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR`.
  - Pseudo-header validation: order, lowercase header names, connection-specific headers rejected, `:path`/`:authority` checks.
  - CONTINUATION interleaving on a different stream → `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.
  - RST_STREAM on an idle stream → `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.
  - HEADERS on a half-closed-remote or closed stream → `STREAM_CLOSED`.
  - HPACK: dynamic-table size update larger than peer-advertised max → `COMPRESSION_ERROR`; size update after a non-size-update representation → `COMPRESSION_ERROR`.
  - Huffman decoder: EOS symbol in the middle of a string rejected; padding must be < 8 bits of all-ones.
- Body duplication when `send_data` split buffers across frames.
- Connection owner notified with `closed` on termination.
- CT suite flakiness: acceptor socket defaulted to active mode, losing data between `ssl:handshake` return and `setopts({active, false})`.
